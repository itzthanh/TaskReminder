# TaskReminder

React application where users enter in a task along with the due date and is added to the task reminder list. The list is sorted from closest due to latest due task from top to bottom by default and counts down the time remaining for each task. The application is responsive and the data is saved via cookies so that users are able to open and close the webpage without losing their tasks.

source code is included in /src/

Edit: After uploading, it appears that my CSS broke and at the moment I have not figured out the cause.
